When exploring the world of CMS or so called "Homepagebaukasten" (an awful german word coining) as a teenager on my way to create my first website I realized that they all did not really fit the bill for me. So I decided to learn how to code and build my own site without further ado.

So then, because coding is fun I went on and after school I started to become a real programmer. Today I participate in some awesome projects.
